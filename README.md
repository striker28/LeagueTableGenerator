This is a JAVA Program I wrote to generate 
the leaderboard or better called the League 
Table for a Sporting event (Here Football)

The program takes as input :
The results of all the fixtures 
and then returns a list of the teams
from top to bottom on the basis of
the following parameters:

1) Points scored
2) Goal Difference
3) Goals For

If the tie still can't be broken, 
the teams are arranged in Alphabetical 
Order

Spain England 3 0<br>
England France 1 1<br>
Spain England 0 2<br>
